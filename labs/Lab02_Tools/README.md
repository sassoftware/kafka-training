# Command-line Tools

In this lab you will experiment with some of the commonly used command-line
utilities that ship with Kafka.  You will use the command-line tools to
interact with a running Kafka server to perform the following tasks:

* Create a new Kafka topic
* View information about an existing Kafka topic
* Publish messages to a Kafka topic
* Consume messages from a Kafka topic
