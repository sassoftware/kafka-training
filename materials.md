## Reference Materials

This class is designed as a hands-on learning environment.
Students will receive an overview of basic concepts during the lectures
and will gain hands-on experience by performing labs.  Most of the
reference material will come from the Apache Kafka project documentation,
Confluent documentation, or other videos and text selected from various
sources.  No books or hardcopy materials are required.

### Overview Training by Stephane Maarek

Stephane Maarek is a solutions architect and consultant in the areas of
Kafka and AWS.  He has produced training material on Udemy and posts
much of the introductory videos on YouTube.  Since this training plan
is meant to provide only a general overview of Kafka, the YouTube
videos will be sufficient.

Here are the list of training videos:

* [Apache Kafka in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzPXRmVHMxI) (5 minutes)
* [Kafka Topics, Partitions and Offsets Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q1IjK5jjyU) (7 minutes)
* [Kafka Brokers and Data Replication Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOU7PJWZU9w) (6 minutes)
* [Kafka Producers Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh_tjm0yPz4) (5 minutes)
* [Kafka Consumers and Consumer Groups Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAdG16KaHLs) (5 minutes)
* [Which Metrics to Monitor in Kafka?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXLe0KNEbR4) (6 minutes)

### Alternate Overview Training by Tim Berglund

Tim Berglund is a Director of Developer Advocacy at Confluent.
He is currently the public face for Confluent at most training and
conference events.  Although he is a good speaker, I find his videos
somewhat fast paced for beginners which is why I provided this YouTube
playlist as an alternate training path in case the primary training
material was not satisfactory. 

The following YouTube playlist contains a series of videos:

* [Apache Kafka Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa7VYi0yPIH2PelhRHoFR5iQgflg-y6JA) (90 Minutes)

### Advanced Training

The advanced training materials offer longer and more in-depth
videos on Kafka and related topics.
